# Pr치xis Revolucion치ria (Legacy)
Pr치xis Revolucion치ria is a legacy project created by the former members of the extinguished Hiscom Studios. This was created while we were game design students of Universidade Anhembi Morumbi as part of our 4th semester evalutation.

<h2> Goals </h2>
<p>
  Our main goal during this project was to show young people (as represented by our persona) how social injustice took place in our society by representing the rich and the poor with two main characters: <br>Douglas</br> and <br>Gislene</br>, and how, even though they have a very different social condition, they were both submitted to the evils of a horrendous political and economical system.
</p>

<h2> Achieved </h2>
<p>
  In order to do what we proposed, we created a very cartoonized 2d point and click videogame were the player should pay close attention to the story as he discovers it by playing a series of minigames with both the protagonists.
